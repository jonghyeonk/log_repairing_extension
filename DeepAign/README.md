# DeepAlign: Alignment-based Process Anomaly Correction Using Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository holds an efficient implementation of the DeepAlign algorithm as proposed in the paper.
The code in this repository can be used to reproduce the results given in the paper.

## Setup

The easiest way to setup an environment is to use Miniconda.

1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (make sure to use a Python 3 version)
2. After setting up miniconda you can make use of the `conda` command in your command line (Powershell, CMD, Bash)
3. We suggest that you set up a dedicated environment for this project by running `conda env create -f environment.yml`
    - This will setup a virtual conda environment with all necessary dependencies.
    - If your device does have a GPU replace `tensorflow` with `tensorflow-gpu` in the `environement.yml`
4. Depending on your operating system you can activate the virtual environment with `conda activate deepalign`
   on Linux and macOS, and `activate deepalign` on Windows (`cmd` only).
5. If you want to make use of a GPU, you must install the CUDA Toolkit. To install the CUDA Toolkit on your computer refer to the [TensorFlow installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows).
6. If you want to quickly install the `deepalign` package, run `pip install -e .` inside the root directory.
7. Now you can start the notebook server by `jupyter notebook notebooks`.

Note: To use the graph plotting methods, you will have to install Graphviz.
